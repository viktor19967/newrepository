					<p>Skiing is my hobby since I was ten,I really enjoy cold weather and snow, because then I have a chance to get on my skiing. When I was 10, I went to Ice Arena in the city of Druskininkai(Lithuania). The arina included large steep track. I tries to slide and I immediately fall. But After several times get the essence. Since that time, I really enjoy skiing. This summer,  Im planning to gor to Alps, to improve my skiing skills.
